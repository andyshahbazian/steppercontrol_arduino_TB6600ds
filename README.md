# steppercontrol_arduino_TB6600ds
Arduino based controller for rotating plate - expecting serial commands from jestson nanao - use softserial  // tested with NEMA 14, micro stepper controller (TB6600) and Arduino Uno  // to test open serial and type "m100 1000" this will move the shaft for 90 degree (adjust per your stepper) 100 will define  the movement and 500 is the steps
